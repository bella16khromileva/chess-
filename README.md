##  Chess
The program randomly places chess pieces on the board. The function step() only checks whether a move is possible or not, but does not move the pieces.

The board is 8 * 8, where the letters are arranged horizontally, the numbers (from 1 to 8) - vertically.
It is assumed that the white pieces move from the bottom, the black ones from the top of the board.
